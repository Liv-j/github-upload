Overall Look and Feel of Peerpark
==================================

The overall look and feel should be minimalist. We will avoid 3D metal looks and add certain effects/decorations to highlight certain objects.
The website should be have a general city feel but muted to be more calming and pleasing to the eye.

Colours
=======
For Peerpark, the colours are those of our logo with variations to adhere to our look and feel.
These are our colour swatches:

- #676A74 -> gray 
- #7396AD -> blue-gray 
- #7ABD6C -> green 
- #BDF2E7 -> light blue 
- #4C6DBD -> dark blue

The colour theme attempts to imitate the feeling of a New York City street.
The dark tones represent the asphalt and concrete jungle, and the blues and greens represent their signature street signs.

* Note: We might use colours that slightly vary from our colours swatches (darker, lighter and/or more blue/green)

Iconography
===========
We will focus on using icons that have a simple design, which adheres to the overall look and feel and have the same tones as our colour palette.

*Note: some icons are provided by Font Awesome (https://fontawesome.com)

Typography

Manrope was chosen because it is open-sourced, meaning it we do not have to pay to use it on the website.
It is also a modern-style font, which helps demonstrate that we are a hip and modern company.
