            <p>The PeerPark app is a free and very user-friendly application that allows users to rent a parking spot
                very quickly. Whether you're living in Toronto or Los Angeles, and you're in desperate need of a parking
                spot all it takes is a couple of minutes to find one! While the app itself is completely free, there are fees for renting a parking spot/posting an ad. In addition, we offer a membership that come with certain fees (check pricing section).</p>
