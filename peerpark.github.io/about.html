        <h2>About PeerPark</h2>
        <p>Over the last decade, we've noticed that the demand for parking spaces in populated cities has substantially
            increased. We wanted to find a way to make parking more affordable and accessible to people who are looking
            for a place to park without having the trouble of looking for spaces or paying expensive fees while in the
            city. We thought of an idea to rent out peopleâ€™s driveways that are not in use, so that others may be able
            to use that space for parking their car. That way people can enjoy the benefit of accessible parking space,
            while others can find a way to make money.</p>
